[h1]Description[/h1]
When colonists are ready for a child, instead of automatically spawning a new child and asking you to name it, the game will allow you to decline or accept their wish to have a new child.
The text of the 'New child' window has been changed to indicate that the parents are THINKING about having a new child so it doesn't sound so murdery :)

[h1]Changelog[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]1.0.1[/b]: Fixed bug when 2nd request would spawn a child regardless.  Increased timer upon rejection so that the game doesn't ask as often.
[*][b]1.0.0[/b]: Initial release
[/list]
